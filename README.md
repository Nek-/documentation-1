# Event Store Documentation

**This documentation is available at [https://eventstore.org/docs](https://eventstore.org/docs).** Pages are built with [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io).

What follows is documentation for how to use and contribute to the Event Store documentation. If youâ€™re planning to make updates or contributions then read on. Otherwise, head on over to the [website](https://eventstore.org/docs).

## Contributing to Event Store Documentation

Event Store consists of different components, and the documentation reflects this. Depending on what you want to contribute to, the process is different.

### Conceptual Documentation

This is the bulk of documentation, and where you mostly likely want to contribute to. It uses 'DocFX flavored Markdown'. It is similar to standard or GitHub Flavored Markdown, but adds features useful for documentation you can find details of [here](#).

### API Spec
<!-- TODO: Open API spec blah -->
In additions to conceptual docs on the HTTP API, the documentation includes a [swagger spec file](#) that [DocFX renders to HTML](#) when building the site. Any contributions to that file are welcome, read the [Swagger xxx](#) for more details on the format of that file.

### Code Documentation
When DocFX builds the documentation site it parses xxx code comments and renders them as HTML. If you want to contribute to that documentation, then find instructions in the [code base reposity](#).

### Documentation Theme
Finally, if you would like to improve the theme for the documentation site, then you can find its repository [here](#).

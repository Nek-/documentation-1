# Step 1 - Install, run, and write your first event

[!include[<Getting Started Intro>](~/getting-started/_intro.md)]

This first step covers installation and running Event Store, and writing your first event.

## Install Event Store Server

### [Windows](#tab/tabid-1)

The prerequisites for Installing on Windows are:

-   NET Framework 4.0+
-   Windows platform SDK with compilers (v7.1) or Visual C++ installed (Only required for a full build)

Event Store has [Chocolatey packages](https://chocolatey.org/packages/eventstore-oss) available that you can install with the following command:

```powershell
choco install eventstore-oss
```

You can also [download](https://eventstore.org/downloads/) a binary, unzip the archive and run from the folder location with an administrator console:

```powershell
EventStore.ClusterNode.exe --db ./db --log ./logs
```

This command starts Event Store with the database stored at the path _./db_ and the logs in _./logs_. You can view further command line arguments in the [server docs](~/server/index.md).

Event Store runs in an administration context because it starts an HTTP server through `http.sys`. For permanent or production instances you need to provide an ACL such as:

```powershell
netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:2113/ user=DOMAIN\username
```

### [Linux](#tab/tabid-2)

The prerequisites for Installing on Linux are:

-   We recommend [Mono 4.6.2](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/), but later versions may also work.

Event Store has pre-built [packages available for Debian-based distributions](https://packagecloud.io/EventStore/EventStore-OSS), [manual instructions for distributions that use RPM](https://packagecloud.io/EventStore/EventStore-OSS/install#bash-rpm), or you can [build from source](https://github.com/EventStore/EventStore#linux).

If you installed from a pre-built package, start Event Store with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start eventstore
```

When you install the Event Store package, the service doesn't start by default. This is to allow you to change the configuration, located at _/etc/eventstore/eventstore.conf_ and to prevent creating a default database.

In all other cases you can run the Event Store binary or use our _run-node.sh_ shell script which exports the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the installation path of Event Store, which is necessary if you are planning to use projections.

```bash
./run-node.sh --db ./ESData
```

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that when using Linux you set the 'open file limit' to a high number. The precise value depends on your use case, but at least between `30,000` and `60,000`.

### [Docker](#tab/tabid-3)

Event Store has [a Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/eventstore/eventstore/) available for any platform that supports Docker:

```bash
docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore
```

> Read the [server](~/server/index.md) section of our documentation for more details on setting up and running the Event Store server.

## Interacting with an Event Store Server

There are three ways to interact with Event Store:

1.  With the admin web interface (more details link).
2.  [With the HTTP API](~/http-api/index.md).
3.  With a Client API, our documentation covers the [.NET API](~/dotnet-api/index.md), but [others](~/getting-started/which-api-sdk.md) are available.

To use a client API you need to install it first, [install the .NET Core client API](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EventStore.ClientAPI.NetCore/) using your preferred method, add it to your project and require it in your code.

```shell
dotnet add package EventStore.Client
```

```csharp
using EventStore.ClientAPI;
```

## Connecting to Event Store

If you want to use the admin web interface or the HTTP API, then you use port `2113`, for example, <http://127.0.0.1:2113/> in your web browser, or `curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113` for the HTTP API.

> [!TIP]
> The default username and password is `admin:changeit`

![The Web Admin Dashboard](~/images/es-web-admin-dashboard.png)

If you want to use the .NET API, then you use port `1113` and create a connection, giving it a name:

[!code-csharp[getting-started-connection](~/code-examples/getting-started/docs-example-csharp/Program.cs?start=32&end=33)]

> [!NEXT]
> In this example we used the [`EventStoreConnection.Create()`](#EventStore.ClientAPI.EventStoreConnection.Create(System.String,System.String)) overloaded method but [others are available](#EventStore.ClientAPI.EventStoreConnection).

## Writing Events to an Event Stream

Event Store operates on a concept of Event Streams, and the first operation we look at is how to write to a stream. If you are Event Sourcing a domain model, a stream equates to an aggregate function. Event Store can handle hundreds of millions of streams, so create as many as you need.

If you post to a stream that doesnâ€™t exist, Event Store creates it before adding the events.

To begin, open a text editor, copy and paste the following event definition, and save it as _event.json_.

[!code-json[getting-started-write-event-json](~/code-examples/getting-started/event.json "The contents of event.json")]

You can write events using the admin web interface by clicking the _Stream Browser_ tab, the _Add Event_ button, filling in the form with relevant values and clicking the _Add_ button at the bottom of the page.

### [HTTP API](#tab/tabid-4)

To use the HTTP API, use the following cURL command, passing the name of the stream and the events to write:

[!code-bash[getting-started-write-event-request](~/code-examples/getting-started/write-event.sh?start=1&end=1)]

> [!NEXT]
> [Read this guide](~/http-api/creating-a-stream.md) for more information on how to write events with the HTTP API.
>
> [!NOTE]
> You can also post events to the HTTP API as XML, by changing the `Content-Type` header to `XML`.

### [.NET API](#tab/tabid-5)

To use the .NET API, use the following method, passing the name of the stream, the version, and the events to write:

[!code-csharp[getting-started-write-event-request](~/code-examples/getting-started/docs-example-csharp/Program.cs?range=95)]

> [!NEXT][read this guide](~/http-api/writing-to-a-stream.md) for more information on how to write events with the .NET API. We don't cover version checking in this guide, but you can read more in [the optimistic concurrency guide](~/dotnet-api/optimistic-concurrency-and-idempotence.md).

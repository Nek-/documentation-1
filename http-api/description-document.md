# Description Document
## What is it?

With the addition of [Competing Consumers](~/getting-started/competing-consumers.md) which is essentially another way of reading streams, the need arose to expose these different methods to consumers.

The introduction of the description document has some benefits

-   Clients can rely on the keys (streams, streamSubscription) in the description document to remain unchanged across versions of Event Store and can be relied on as a lookup for the particular method of reading a stream.
-   Allows the restructuring of URIs underneath without breaking clients. e.g. `/streams/newstream` -> `/streams/newstream/atom`

## How do I get the description document?

There are 3 ways in which the description document will be returned.

-   Attempting to read a stream with an unsupported media type.
-   Attempting to read a stream with no accept header.
-   Requesting the description document explicitly.

The client is able to request the description document by passing `application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json` in the `accept` header
e.g.

### [Request](#tab/tabid-1)

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:2113/streams/newstream -H "accept:application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json"
```

### [Response](#tab/tabid-2)

```bash

    "self": {
      "href": "/streams/newstream",
      "supportedContentTypes": [
        "application/vnd.eventstore.streamdesc+json"
      ]
    },
    "stream": {
      "href": "/streams/newstream",
      "supportedContentTypes": [
        "application/atom+xml",
        "application/vnd.eventstore.atom+json"
      ]
    },
    "streamSubscription": [
      {
        "href": "/subscriptions/newstream/competing_consumers_group1",
        "supportedContentTypes": [
          "application/vnd.eventstore.competingatom+xml",
          "application/vnd.eventstore.competingatom+json"
        ]
      },
      {
        "href": "/subscriptions/newstream/competing_consumers_group2",
        "supportedContentTypes": [
          "application/vnd.eventstore.competingatom+xml",
          "application/vnd.eventstore.competingatom+json"
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

* * *

In the example above, the client has requested the description document for the stream called `newstream` which has a set of links which describes the supported methods and content types for reading.

The document also includes additional methods if they are available such as the `streamSubscription` (Which is HTTP Competing Consumers). What is displayed in the example above is that there are 2 subscriptions for the `newstream`, namely `competing_consumers_group1` and `competing_consumers_group2`. If there are no subscriptions to the `newstream`, the `streamSubscription` key will be absent.

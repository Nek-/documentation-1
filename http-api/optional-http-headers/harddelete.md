# Optional HTTP Headers: HardDelete

The `ES-HardDelete` header controls deleting a stream. By default Event Store will soft delete a stream allowing you to later reuse that stream. If you set the `ES-HardDelete` header the stream will be permanently deleted.

### [Request](#tab/tabid-1)
```bash
curl -v -X DELETE http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/foo -H "ES-HardDelete:true"
```

### [Response](#tab/tabid-2)

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 Stream deleted
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Server: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST, DELETE, GET, OPTIONS

This changes the general behavior from returning a '404' and recreatable to having the stream now return '410 GONE' forever.

### [Request](#tab/tabid-1)

```bash
curl -i http://127.0.0.1:2113/streams/foo2
```

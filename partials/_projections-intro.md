Projections is an Event Store subsystem that lets you write new events or link existing events to streams in a reactive manner.

Projections are good at solving one specific query type, a category known as 'temporal correlation queries'. This query type is common in business systems and few can execute these queries well.

> [!NOTE]
> Projections require the event body to be in JSON.

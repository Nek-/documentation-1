# Cluster node roles

Every node in an Event Store cluster can have one of three roles.

## Master

A cluster assigns the `Master` role based on an election process. The node with the `Master` role ensures that the data are committed and persisted to disk before sending back to the client an acknowledge message. A cluster can only have one Master at a time. If a cluster detects two nodes with a Master role, a new election begins and shuts down the node with less data to restart and re-join the cluster.

## Slave

A cluster assigns the `Slave` role based on an election process. A cluster uses one or more nodes with the `Slave` role to form the quorum, or the majority of nodes necessary to confirm that a write is persisted.

## Clone

If you add nodes to a cluster beyond the number of nodes specified in the `ClusterSize` setting the cluster automatically assigns them the `Clone` role.

A cluster asynchronously replicates data one way to a node with the `Clone` role. You don't need to wait for an acknowledgement message as the node is not part of the quorum. For this reason a node with a `Clone` role does not add much overhead to the other nodes.

If a cluster loses nodes to take it below `ClusterSize`, then the cluster can promote a `Clone` to a `Master` or `Slave` role.

You can control which clones the cluster promotes with the `NodePriority` [command line option](~/server/command-line-arguments.md). The default value is `0`, and the cluster is more likely to promote clones with higher values.

> [!NOTE]
> Changing `NodePriority` doesn't guarantee that the cluster won't promote the clone. It's only one of the criteria that the Election Service considers.

## Non-promotable clone

If you want the cluster to never promote a node with the `Clone` role, set the `--is-promotable` [command line option](~/server/command-line-arguments.md) to `false` when starting a clone node. The node never acknowledges any writes and is never part of the quorum until you change the option to `true`.

Non promotable clones are best used for data redundancy, or for locally hosted nodes you use for application testing.
